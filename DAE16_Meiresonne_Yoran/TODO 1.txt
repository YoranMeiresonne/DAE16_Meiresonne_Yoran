Enemy Behaviour:
Move Left and Right
Jump,
Attack

-Bubble:

Class Map Useless.

Player press space -> Creates Bullet -> Bullet moves for … Time or until hit something
Player Press space again -> creates another bullet -> bullet Move for … Time or hit something


Creating bubble done, now make its animation and delete part. (done)


Bubble Hit Enemy -> Bubble get deleted, Enemy goes through hit animation
Needed: Knowing Which bubble hit, which enemy was hit
How Do:

Bubble Hit enemy -> enemy bubble animation (\/) -> Hit Bubble enemy -> defeated animation (motion needs to be done) -> after hitting a platform or ground dissapear and place a item there.
So Defeated animation land when hittin platform (DefeatedHitGround) (Done)

CharacterController Line 92- 101 Check and fix 
Fix it in Zen_Chan Tingy 

Enemy has 2 Jumps : Verticall when object above, horizontal when there is a gap
If player above them = vertical jump. (Kinda done keep going up to keep up with player)
Need something to detect a gap


Enemy get stuck when hit boundry wall
Enemy HitWall need fixing (when hit it their x velociti = 0?)
